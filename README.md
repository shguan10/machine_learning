## Independent Projects in Machine Learning

Here are my projects with a machine learning theme.

### Operating System: 
Windows (unfortunately, all of the filename paths use the Windows convention with "\\")

### Interpreter: 
python2

### Dependencies: 
1. numpy
2. Tkinter
3. gzip
4. cPickle

### Currently I have: 
1. digit classifier interface
+ To see the demo, cd to the digit_classifier directory and run 'python nninter.py'
2. digit reconstructor
+ To see the demo, run `python dbnRun.py`. This will load the dbn with default weights, train it for 20 epochs, write the new weights to a file and finally display the reconstructed digits.
+ To only see the reconstructed digits using the default weights, run `python dbnDisplay.py`
