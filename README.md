## Independent Projects in Machine Learning

Here are my projects with a machine learning theme.

### Operating System: 
Windows (unfortunately, all of the filename paths use the Windows convention with "\\")

### Interpreter: 
python2

### Dependencies: 
1. numpy
2. Tkinter
3. gzip
4. cPickle

### List of Projects
1. digit classifier interface
   + To see the demo, run `python nninter.py`. This will load the 3-layer ReLU neural network with default weights, and display a grid, where you can draw a digit and see if the machine recognizes it. 
   + NOTE: As the machine was trained on images centered on the 28x28 grid, try to draw digits that are also centered. The machine will perform better.
2. digit reconstructor
    + To see the demo, run `python dbnRun.py`. This will load the dbn with default weights, train it for 20 epochs, write the new weights to a file and finally display the reconstructed digits.
    + To only see the reconstructed digits using the default weights, run `python dbnDisplay.py`
