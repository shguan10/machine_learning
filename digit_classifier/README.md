# digit classifier 
## Dependencies
+ numpy
+ cPickle
## Interpreter
+ python2

## My Code
+ nninter.py

## Code based on [the tutorial](neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)
+ mnist_loader.py
+ network.py

## Notes
I followed the tutorial to learn the ropes of a vanilla neural network. I was inspired to create an interface for the neural network, found in nninter.py

The tutorial also inspired me to research more into Deep Belief Networks, which I used to build my digit reconstructors.
