# digit classifier 
mnist_loader.py and network.py was taken from the helpful tutorial found on https://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/

I followed the tutorial to learn the ropes of a vanilla neural network. I was inspired to create an interface for the neural network, found in nninter.py

The tutorial also inspired me to research more into Deep Belief Networks, which I used to build my digit reconstructors.
