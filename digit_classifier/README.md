# digit classifier 
## Operating System
+ Windows

## Interpreter
+ python2

## Dependencies
+ numpy
+ pickle
+ Tkinter
+ os
+ gzip

## My Code
+ nninter.py
   + This is also the demo. Run `python nninter.py` to see my machine in action.

## Code based on [this helpful tutorial](http://www.neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)
+ mnist_loader.py
+ network2_ReLU.py

## Notes
I followed the tutorial to learn the ropes of a vanilla neural network. I was inspired to create an interface for the neural network, found in nninter.py

The tutorial also inspired me to research more into Deep Belief Networks, which I used to build my digit reconstructors.
